## Tile & Perimeter Calculator that:
Quickly lets you know the tiles, boxes, and perimeter to make floor tile laying easy.

Let's you add multiple rooms (supports decimals and simple fractions like 12 1/2)

Calculates total area (sq ft), perimeter (ft) (also shown as a mixed fraction), tiles needed (with waste), and boxes needed (by box coverage)

Uses feet for rooms and inches for tile sizes (the usual way tile is sold)
